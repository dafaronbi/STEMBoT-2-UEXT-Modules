The STEMBoT 2 (SB2)  is a mobile robotic platform and successor to SBIâ€™s first product, the CEENBoT, which 
saw success in schools throughout the United States. The development goal of the SB2 project is to create a 
modular and easy-to-use product that will be used as a platform for teaching STEM related skills to students 
from kindergarten to the university level. The SB2 will accomplish this goal by incorporating the Python programming 
language into embedded systems development. The SB2 also uses plug-and-play UEXT modules for customizability and increased functionality.
